# My Zero Day Security Flaws
## Author: Romain Claret

## What is it?
Here is my repo with zero-day security flaws I publish.

## Ethical point of view
The flaws exposed here are not exploited in a way that could harm users. However, someone could use it in a malicious way, so be careful.

## What am I trying to do by publishing those security flaws?
- I believe that I am not the only one able to find those, my point here is to show right away what is possible to do with those.
- I also believe that the people in charge will be able to fix those faster if they are aware that people are aware.
- Plus those flows can sometimes be reproduced on other systems, it's good for them too to know what is done elsewhere.
